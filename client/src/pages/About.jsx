          who, like countless others, navigated the chaotic maze of finding
          suitable hostel accommodation. The endless phone calls, unreliable
          brokers, and fragmented information were a constant struggle.

            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
              For students and working professionals, finding reliable, safe,
              and affordable hostel accommodation is often a daunting task.
              Information is scattered across WhatsApp groups, local agents, and
              outdated listings. Hostel owners, on the other hand, struggle to
              effectively showcase their properties and reach their target
              audience beyond word-of-mouth. This disconnect leads to
              frustration for both parties.
